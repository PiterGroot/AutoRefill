# AutoRefill - BTA 7.1_01

_This mod is still in development_
<br>_Requires HalbLibe => 3.5.4_

A singleplayer minecraft beta mod specifically made for Minecraft Better Than Adventure 7.1_01.

AutoRefill is a small QoL mod that automatically tries to replace the block stack you just fully consumed (if available) from one of your other inventory slots. This makes building for example a lot more pleasant.
